Webflow
=======
By integrating your Webflow account with Resmo, you can monitor and analyze your website's data, structure, and performance. Webflow is a popular web design and development platform that enables users to create responsive, visually stunning websites without writing code. Connecting Resmo with Webflow allows you to access and query data from Webflow to gain insights into your website's design, publishing status, and domain configuration.

With Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Webflow data, such as:

* What are the details of the sites, webhooks, access groups, and domains in my Webflow account?
* How often are sites published, and what are their last published dates?
* What are the different access groups and their permissions for each site?
* Which webhooks are triggered by specific events, and when were they last used?
* What are the domain configurations for each site, and when were they last updated?

Setting up change alerts in Resmo can help you stay informed about important changes and events in your Webflow data. For example:

* Get notified when a new site is created or updated.
* Receive an alert when a webhook is added or modified.
* Get notified when an access group is created or updated in a site.
* Receive an alert when a domain configuration is changed or a new domain is added.

Integrating your Webflow account with Resmo allows you to effectively monitor your website's data, structure, and performance, ensuring that your site remains up-to-date, secure, and visually appealing. Leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can stay informed about essential changes and events in your Webflow data, allowing you to make better design and development decisions for your website.
