Integrating your Wizer account with Resmo enables you to gain valuable insights into your organization's employee training progress, helping you understand how well your employees are advancing through Wizer's security awareness training courses. By collecting and analyzing data from Wizer, Resmo can help you assess the effectiveness of your training program, identify areas for improvement, and ensure your employees are well-equipped to handle security threats.

With Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Wizer data:

* What is the progress of each employee on their assigned training courses, including completion status and timestamps?
* Which departments have the highest and lowest overall progress rates in completing the training courses?
* How does the training progress vary between different courses or modules?
* Which employees have not yet completed their training and may require additional support or reminders?
* Are there any patterns or trends in training progress that can help identify specific areas of concern?

Setting up change alerts can be beneficial for monitoring critical changes in your Wizer data:

* Get notified when an employee completes a training course, allowing you to track their progress and celebrate their achievements.
* Receive an alert when a department's overall progress rate changes significantly, indicating potential challenges or successes in the training program.
* Monitor updates to individual employee progress, such as a sudden increase or decrease in completed courses, to identify areas where additional support may be needed.
* Stay informed about new courses or modules added to the training program and track their impact on overall employee progress.
* Track changes in training progress across different departments or job roles, helping you identify areas where additional resources or focus may be required.

In conclusion, integrating your Wizer account with Resmo provides valuable insights into your organization's employee training progress, helping you optimize your security awareness training program. By leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can keep track of employee progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure your employees are well-prepared to handle security threats.
