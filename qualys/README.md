Integrating your Qualys account with Resmo allows you to gain valuable insights into your organization's security posture. Qualys is a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions that help organizations identify, mitigate, and prevent security threats. With Resmo, you can collect and analyze data from Qualys, enabling you to better understand your organization's vulnerabilities, assets, and compliance status.

Using Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Qualys data, such as:

* What are the details of users, host assets, host findings, compliance scans, and vulnerabilities within the organization?
* How are web application scans, web applications, and web application findings managed and detected?
* What are the trends in vulnerabilities, findings, and assets over time?
* Which assets are most vulnerable, and what are the most common vulnerabilities affecting them?
* How effective are the organization's compliance efforts, and what areas require improvement?

Setting up change alerts can be helpful for monitoring critical changes in your Qualys data. For example:

* Get notified when a new user is created, updated, or deleted.
* Receive an alert when a host asset is discovered, updated, or removed.
* Get notified when a host finding is detected, updated, or resolved.
* Receive an alert when a compliance scan is initiated, completed, or updated.
* Get notified when a vulnerability is discovered, updated, or mitigated.

By integrating your Qualys account with Resmo, you can effectively monitor your organization's security posture and take prompt action to address vulnerabilities and compliance issues. Leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can ensure that your security processes are efficient, effective, and aligned with your organization's risk management objectives.
