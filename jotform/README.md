=======
Integrating your Jotform account with Resmo allows you to gain valuable insights into your organization's form management, submissions, and reporting. Jotform is a powerful online form builder that enables you to create, publish, and manage forms easily. By collecting and analyzing data from Jotform, Resmo can help you understand your form configurations, submission counts, and report settings.

With Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Jotform data, such as:

* What are the details of each form, including its status, type, title, and other configurations?
* How many submissions have been received for each form, and when was the last submission received?
* What are the details of each report, including its fields, settings, and associated form information?
* How are sub-users set up, including their permissions, status, and associated forms?

Setting up change alerts can be beneficial for monitoring critical changes in your Jotform data. For example:

* Get notified when a new form is created, updated, or archived.
* Receive an alert when the submission count for a form changes.
* Get notified when a report is created, updated, or deleted.
* Receive an alert when changes are made to sub-user settings, such as permissions or status.

In conclusion, integrating your Jotform account with Resmo provides valuable insights into your organization's form management, submissions, and reporting. By leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can stay on top of important changes and ensure that your Jotform configurations are optimized for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
