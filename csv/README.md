CSV
===
Resmo's CSV integration is a user-friendly and flexible feature that allows users to upload their CSV files as Resmo resources with custom schemas. This capability enables users to integrate data from on-premise tools, sources without existing Resmo integrations such as directory tools for employees, and address security concerns by controlling how data is sent to Resmo.

By using the CSV integration, users can:

* Define their own resource schemas: Users can create custom data structures tailored to their specific needs, making it easier to work with the data in Resmo and ensuring it's organized in a way that is meaningful to them.
* Integrate data from various sources: With the ability to upload CSV files, users can connect to a wide range of data sources, including on-premise systems, proprietary tools, or third-party APIs, extending Resmo's capabilities beyond the pre-built integrations.
* Leverage offline data: Users can easily import data from offline sources, such as spreadsheet applications or locally stored databases, making it simple to combine offline and online data within Resmo for more comprehensive analysis.
* Address security concerns: By controlling how data is sent to Resmo through CSV uploads, users can ensure that their data remains secure and compliant with their organization's policies. The manual process of uploading CSV files allows users to review and manage data before it enters the Resmo platform.
* Leverage Resmo's powerful features: Once the CSV data is integrated into Resmo, users can take advantage of the platform's robust SQL query capabilities, visualization tools, and change alerts to analyze and monitor their data effectively.

In summary, Resmo's CSV integration provides users with a simple and flexible method to incorporate various data sources into their Resmo account, regardless of their origin or format. By uploading CSV files with custom resource schemas, users can tailor their Resmo experience to their specific needs, leveraging the platform's powerful features to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
