Figma
=====
Integrating Resmo with Figma provides insights into your design projects, files, and collaboration efforts, enabling you to monitor and optimize your design process.

Using Resmo's SQL query capabilities, you can ask focused questions about your Figma data:

* Which projects are associated with a specific team, and what are their names and IDs?
* What are the details of each project file, including the associated branches and last modified dates?
* How do webhooks interact with design events, and what is their current status?

Setting up change alerts can help you monitor important updates in your Figma data:

* Receive notifications when a new project is created or modified, keeping you informed of design project progress.
* Get alerted when a file is updated or its branches change, ensuring you stay aware of design iterations.
* Track the status of webhooks, which can help you maintain smooth integrations with other services.

In summary, integrating Resmo with Figma helps you understand and optimize your design process by offering insights into projects, files, and webhooks. Using SQL queries and change alerts, you can monitor design project progress, file updates, and webhook interactions, ultimately improving your design workflow and collaboration.
