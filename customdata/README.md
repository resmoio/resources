Custom Data
===========
Resmo's Custom Data integration with webhooks is a versatile and powerful feature that allows users to create their own resource schemas and send data either as a single entry or in batches. This flexibility enables users to integrate data from on-premise tools, sources without existing Resmo integrations, and address security concerns by controlling how data is sent to Resmo.

By using the Custom Data integration with webhooks, users can:

* Define their own resource schemas: Users can create custom data structures tailored to their specific needs, making it easier to work with the data in Resmo and ensuring it's organized in a way that is meaningful to them.
* Integrate data from various sources: With the ability to send data via webhooks, users can connect to a wide range of data sources, including on-premise systems, proprietary tools, or third-party APIs, extending Resmo's capabilities beyond the pre-built integrations.
* Send data as a single entry or in batches: Users can choose to send data as individual entries or in batches, giving them control over the granularity and frequency of updates, optimizing data ingestion, and reducing the load on their systems.
* Address security concerns: By controlling how data is sent to Resmo, users can ensure that their data remains secure and compliant with their organization's policies. Webhooks allow for secure data transmission and can be configured to work with various authentication methods.
* Leverage Resmo's powerful features: Once the custom data is integrated into Resmo, users can take advantage of the platform's robust SQL query capabilities, visualization tools, and change alerts to analyze and monitor their data effectively.

In summary, Resmo's Custom Data integration with webhooks provides users with the flexibility to incorporate any data source into their Resmo account, no matter how unique, specific, or security-sensitive. By creating custom resource schemas and sending data via webhooks, users can tailor their Resmo experience to their specific needs, leveraging the platform's powerful features to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
