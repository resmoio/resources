LastPass
========
Resmo's LastPass integration allows you to analyze and monitor your organization's password management and security data. LastPass is a popular password manager that helps users securely store and manage their login credentials. By connecting Resmo with LastPass, you can access and query data from LastPass to gain insights into your organization's password management practices, user activity, and group structures.

Utilizing Resmo's SQL query capabilities, you can explore complex questions about your LastPass data, such as:

* How many active users are there in the organization, and what are their full names, user names, and email addresses?
* What are the different groups in the organization, and how many users are in each group?
* How many applications, attachments, form fills, notes, and sites are associated with each user?
* What is the overall password strength score for each user, and how does it compare with other users in the organization?

By setting up change alerts in Resmo, you can stay informed about important updates and events in your LastPass data. For example:

* Get notified when a new user joins the organization or when a user's information is updated.
* Receive an alert when a user's password is changed or when multi-factor authentication is enabled or disabled.
* Get notified when there are significant changes in users' password management practices, such as the creation or deletion of applications, attachments, form fills, notes, or sites.
* Receive an alert when a new group is created or when an existing group is modified or deleted.

Integrating your LastPass account with Resmo can help you enhance your organization's security by providing actionable insights into password management practices and user activity.
