Sentry
======
Integrating your Sentry account with Resmo allows you to monitor and analyze your application's performance, errors, and user issues. Sentry is a widely used platform that provides real-time monitoring and error tracking for applications, helping developers identify, diagnose, and resolve issues quickly. By connecting Resmo with Sentry, you can access and query data from Sentry, enabling you to better understand your application's health and user experience.

Using Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Sentry data, such as:

* What are the details of users, teams, integrations, repositories, projects, and organizations within the application?
* How many errors have occurred in a specific project or across all projects?
* Which errors are most common and require immediate attention?
* Are there any trends in the types of errors or their frequency over time?
* How do different teams or users within the organization interact with the application?

Setting up change alerts in Resmo can help you stay informed about important changes and events in your Sentry data. For example:

* Get notified when a new user is created, updated, or deleted.
* Receive an alert when a team is created, updated, or removed.
* Get notified when an integration is added, updated, or deactivated.
* Receive an alert when a repository is created, updated, or removed.
* Get notified when a project is created, updated, or deleted.
* Receive an alert when an organization's settings or status change.

By integrating your Sentry account with Resmo, you can effectively monitor your application's performance and errors, ensuring that issues are identified and resolved promptly. Leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can maintain a healthy application and provide a seamless user experience for your customers.
