Integrating your Fastly account with Resmo offers valuable insights into your organization's content delivery, caching, and security configurations. Fastly is a leading-edge cloud platform that provides CDN, edge computing, and other web optimization services.

* Receive an alert when an account's configuration or contact information is updated.
* Get notified when an API token is created, modified, or deleted.
* Receive an alert when a Fastly service is created, updated, or encounters issues.
