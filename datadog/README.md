Datadog
=======
Integrating your Datadog account with Resmo provides valuable insights into your monitoring, alerting, and analytics configurations. Datadog is a powerful monitoring and analytics platform that helps organizations gain visibility into their infrastructure, applications, and services. Resmo collects and analyzes Datadog's configuration data to identify potential security risks, ensure adherence to best practices, and optimize configurations for efficiency and effectiveness.

Using Resmo's SQL query capabilities, users can ask complex questions about their Datadog configuration data, such as:

* Which users have access to specific resources, and what permissions and roles do they have?
* How many API and application keys are in use, and who created or modified them?
* What are the details of AWS integrations, including access keys, account IDs, and enabled features?
* How many monitors are configured, and what are their settings, priorities, and overall states?
* What are the organization settings, including billing and subscription types, SAML configurations, and public and private sharing options?

Setting up change alerts in Resmo for your Datadog account can also be beneficial for monitoring critical configuration changes, such as:

* Notifications when users are added, removed, or have their permissions or roles changed.
* Alerts when API keys, application keys, or AWS integrations are created, modified, or deleted.
* Updates when monitors are added, updated, or removed, and when their states change.
* Notifications when organization settings, such as SAML configurations or subscription types, are modified.

In conclusion, integrating your Datadog account with Resmo offers valuable insights into your organization's monitoring, alerting, and analytics configurations. By leveraging Resmo's SQL query capabilities and change alerting, you can stay on top of important changes and ensure that your Datadog configurations are optimized for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
